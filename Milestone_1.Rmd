For my final project, I'm considering to replicate a paper called "Can Extreme Poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa be Eliminated by 2030?" by Zorobabel Bicabaa, Zuzana Brixiov√°, and Mthuli Ncube. This paper looks at data from the World Bank and argues that with certain conditions, poverty rates can be reduced, although not eradicated, in Sub-Saharan Africa. I'm excited to explore the topic of African Economic Development as I am hoping to use some of this data in my senior thesis.
